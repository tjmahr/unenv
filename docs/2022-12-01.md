### duckdb

duckdb is awesome. I used it in a project to read in all of control
files (tsv files) in a folder into a database with the following code.
There is a lot to unpack here, but here are the main ideas:

  - dplyr is used to generate the queries that sent to the database.
  
  - The functions that start with `regexp_` are duckdb functions, not R
    functions, but that's not a problem because the code that will be
    run is SQL code in the database.
    
  - Normally, `tbl()` is used to specify a table in a database, but
    here, the database table is constructed from the tsv files using
    `read_csv_auto()` with wildcard characters.
    
  - The code in `run_control_file_query()` produces a SQL query. The
    line with `compute()` is the one that actually has the database
    execute the query and store the results in a database table.


``` r
library(DBI)
library(dplyr)
con <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(dbdir = "data-raw/data.duckdb"))

# Generates a SQL query from all the control files in the
# working directory
run_control_file_query <- function() {
  tbl(con, "read_csv_auto('*Control*File-*.txt', FILENAME = TRUE)") |>
    # this all gets converted to SQL statements that will be executed by the
    # database, so there is a mix of R functions and duckdb functions here.
    select(
      control_file = filename,
      repeat_no = Repeat,
      sentence = Sentence,
      response = Response,
      s_word = SWord,
      m_word = MWord,
      m_word_a = MWordA,
      phonetic_sentence = `Phonetic Sentence`,
      phonetic_response = `Phonetic Response`,
      audio_file = File,
    ) |>
    mutate(
      control_file_number = control_file |>
        regexp_extract('\\d{7}\\d+'),
      item = audio_file |>
        toupper() |>
        # fix files with a subscript letter (S7T10a)
        regexp_replace("[ABCDE].WAV", ".WAV") |>
        # fix files with an extra 0(WT010)
        regexp_replace("0(\\d\\d).WAV", "\\1.WAV") |>
        regexp_extract('(S|S\\d|W)(T)\\d\\d.WAV') |>
        left(-4L),
      tocs_type = ifelse(
        substr(item, 1L, 1L) == "W",
        "single-word",
        "multiword"
      )
    )
}

# Create a table from the first batch of files
withr::with_dir("../files-to-import/2022-10-27-batch-1/", {
  DBI::dbRemoveTable(con, "control_files")
  run_control_file_query() |>
    compute(name = "control_files", temporary = FALSE)
})
```
