**Base graphics in knitr**. I learned while porting over some old notes
that `par()` options are not preserved between knitr chunks unless
`opts_knit$get("global.par")` is `TRUE`. It's `FALSE` by default. No
funny business using `old <- par(...)`

Paul recommended using Frank Harrel's `rms::orm()` function for ordinal
regression.

**`eval()` is stack inconsistent**. `base::eval()` and `rlang::eval_bare()` [do things differently](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/eval_bare.html).

Here are the examples from `?eval_bare()`


```r
# eval_bare() works just like base::eval() but you have to create
# the evaluation environment yourself:
eval_bare(quote(foo), env(foo = "bar"))
#> [1] "bar"

# eval() has different evaluation semantics than eval_bare(). It
# can return from the supplied environment even if its an
# environment that is not on the call stack (i.e. because you've
# created it yourself). The following would trigger an error with
# eval_bare():
ret <- quote(return("foo"))
eval(ret, env())
#> [1] "foo"
# eval_bare(ret, env())  # "no function to return from" error

# Another feature of eval() is that you can control surround loops:
bail <- quote(break)
while (TRUE) {
  eval(bail)
  # eval_bare(bail)  # "no loop for break/next" error
}

# To explore the consequences of stack inconsistent semantics, let's
# create a function that evaluates `parent.frame()` deep in the call
# stack, in an environment corresponding to a frame in the middle of
# the stack. For consistency with R's lazy evaluation semantics, we'd
# expect to get the caller of that frame as result:
fn <- function(eval_fn) {
  list(
    returned_env = middle(eval_fn),
    actual_env = current_env()
  )
}
middle <- function(eval_fn) {
  deep(eval_fn, current_env())
}
deep <- function(eval_fn, eval_env) {
  expr <- quote(parent.frame())
  eval_fn(expr, eval_env)
}

# With eval_bare(), we do get the expected environment:
fn(rlang::eval_bare)
#> $returned_env
#> <environment: 0x55cac3595df8>
#> 
#> $actual_env
#> <environment: 0x55cac3595df8>
#> 

# But that's not the case with base::eval():
fn(base::eval)
#> $returned_env
#> <environment: 0x55cac1cc7980>
#> 
#> $actual_env
#> <environment: 0x55cac1cc2170>
#> 
```
