ðŸ¦œ "(Recall the dictum that mixture models all have computational
problems and that all computational problems are essentially mixture
models.)" - Andrew Gelman [commenting on a
comment][gelman-mixture-comment].

ðŸ¦œ â€˜Because this generation of symptoms entails a complex of
"subject-internal" activities, we can never speak in the strictest sense
in terms of simulator-centered "nocebo effects", but only in terms of
subject-centered "nocebo responses".â€™ - [Wikipedia][nocebo-wiki]
being intriguingly pedantic insisting that there is no placebo "effect",
only placebo "responses".

ðŸ”— A [treatment of NA values][na-values-monad] with wrapper functions
with a comparison to monads.

I need to make a keyboard shortcut to extract Markdown 
`[inline links](long-url)` and convert them to `[reference links][ref]`.

I had to compare how each listener differed from the mean of the other
listeners, so I cooked up:

```
leave_one_out_apply <- function(xs, f, ...) {
  lapply(seq_along(xs), function(i) f(xs[-i], ...) )
}
```

### Positron notes

Getting up and running with R is pretty straightforward: install R,
install RStudio, install packages from CRAN, and off you go. Python is
more, uh, nonlinear: Install an environment manager and have it cordon
off little subversions of Python and sublibraries, install some IDE or
work in the browser ðŸ¤·. I'm not a Python guy; I don't know the easy route
to get up and running. I know that there is some amount of configuration 
overhead. 

This contrast between R and Python also describes the different
experiences between RStudio and Positron. Why does it feel like I'm
always configuring stuff in Positron? Well, it's because it inherits
from VSCode and VSCode is for *everything* and you can't support
*everything* without being extremely configurable or "hackable". Plus, I
don't know what I want from Positron quite yet, and RStudio has had
like 10 year headstart on Positron, so I'm going to remain charitable
and supportive of the team.

That said, here are keyboard shortcuts I added recently. I would have
added [WrapRmd](https://github.com/tjmahr/WrapRmd) but they need to [fix
some things](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/8771).

```json
// Place your key bindings in this file to override the defaults
[
  {
    // targets::tar_load() a symbol
    "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+l",
    "command": "workbench.action.executeCode.console",
    "when": "editorTextFocus",
    "args": {
        "langId": "r",
        "code": "targets::rstudio_addin_tar_load()",
        "focus": false
    }
  },
  {
    // Preview result of knitr::knit() on selection
    "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+k",
    "command": "workbench.action.executeCode.console",
    "when": "editorTextFocus",
    "args": {
        "langId": "r",
        "code": "WrapRmd::knit_selection_addin()",
        "focus": false
    }
  }
]
```
